    "# EE194 Lab 0: Chisel - Part 1: Introduction to Scala, Chisel & Chisel Combinational Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted from [Scott Beamer](https://scottbeamer.net/)’s [CSE 228A - Agile Hardware Design](https://github.com/agile-hw) lecture demos + labs & [FreeChipsProject Chisel bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp)\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of labs aim to be a concentrated combination of both of the above resources. We expect this series of labs to take ~6-10 hours total, across all parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A paradigm shift from EECS151...\n",
    "Designing a large SoC in ~18 weeks means changing the way we think about large scale design. You might've done/heard the following about large scale designs in industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The traditional \"waterfall\" method of design:\n",
    "![](./images/trad-hw.svg)\n",
    "* Complete each stage before moving on\n",
    "* Late integration or changes to design during optimization requires changing everything -- design, spec, reimplmentation, reoptimize, reverify...\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like a large construction project: You carefully plan to ensure everything goes smoothly, you construct lots of tests, double check everything before you start construction (because once you construct, you can't change it again/or it is very difficult to change it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agile method of design:\n",
    "What if... \n",
    "\n",
    "a) It was easy to change a design? -- Change the cache capacity just by modifying 1 parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Had a wealth of reuseable modules at your disposal that you could reuse across projects? -- Need a Page Table Walker? Bring it in from another project and instantiate it with 1 line.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Generate a memory controller dynamically at compile time based on parameters you've supplied... Without writing RTL that is specifically targeted for that 1 design specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Disconnect your RTL from the underlying implementation technology: 1 set of RTL, build for FPGA or ASIC without thinking about changing your SRAMs to FPGA friendly memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Rip out an old module, hack in a new one, be able to unit test immediately even if the rest of the hardware immediately using that module isn't built... \n",
    "\n",
    "Agile design is:\n",
    "* Recognizing that the end goal (or the path to it) will always be changing & hard to set in stone/know in advance.\n",
    "* Realizing that during the process of designing, the designer will need to constantly reassess and adapt/change their design.\n",
    "* Given the above, recognizing that there needs to be a way to easily integrate & test new designs, be able to change large chunks of a design without having to rebuild the entire thing from a new spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/agile-hw.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chisel: Constructing Hardware in a Scala Embedded Language\n",
    "* A language built on top of Scala (essentially a series of Scala packages) that enables construction of synthesizable hardware designs.\n",
    "* Aims to harness the benefits of a traditional object-oriented software programming language (Scala) and apply those benefits to designing (and dynamically generating) hardware.\n",
    "* Chisel ≠ Scala!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scala:**\n",
    "* Strongly statically typed language supporting both Object-Oriented and functional programming.\n",
    "* Can be compiled to Java and run on the JVM, provides native interoperability with Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chisel's goal is:\n",
    "* Allow you to improve your design through iteration/revision, without having to implement an overly ambitious initial design\n",
    "* Allow you to better allocate design & effort once you can see how things start fitting together\n",
    "* Design for reuse of components\n",
    "* Design for readability \n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful references/resources:\n",
    "* Scala syntax cheatsheet: https://docs.scala-lang.org/cheatsheets/index.html \n",
    "* Scala getting started guide: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/basics.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chisel Cookbook: https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs/cookbooks\n",
    "* Chisel Explanations: https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs/explanations\n",

    "# Notes/Context:\n",
    "## Scala's execution mechanisms / Why we are on a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "Scala typically has 2 execution mechanisms:\n",
    "1. Compile -> Execute\n",
    "* Compile Scala program and run on JVM -- This is what Chipyard does\n",
    "* Code need to be structured in classes & there needs to be a `main` class\n",
    "* Need a build tool such as `sbt` (Used by Chipyard) to compile\n",
    "2. Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)\n",
    "* Write & evaluate a single line at time\n",
    "* What these Jupyter notebooks do\n",
    "    * We wanted you all do be able to do the labs before getting BWRC accounts / not have to deal with immediately doing account setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chisel Versioning\n",
    "* You might see many versions of Chisel throughout Chipyard, looking at documentation, etc...\n",
    "* This lab uses Chisel 3.6.1 - Chipyard is compatible with this version of Chisel, however, some projects have support for Chisel 6 and Chisel 7. For the most part, you don't need to worry about Chisel versioning. Existing code (including those in Chipyard) will automatically pull in the right versions.\n",
    "* Be aware when reading documentation. Some of the docs supplied above are for Chisel 7, meaning some functions might not be available in Chisel 3. But as far as staff can tell, you shouldn't run into those issues for these labs.\n",
    "* Relevant Chisel Versions:\n",
    "    * 3.6.1 (June 2024) is the bridge from the old to the new\n",
    "    * 6.7 (March 2025) is the most recent released version\n",
    "    * 7 is under public development\n",
    "    * There is no version 4, as it was skipped to make version jump apparent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "* There is a (short) debugging guide in the `part0` folder. It is intended to be a \"just-in-time\" lab in the sense that you read it whenever you need it/tips on how debugging works in Chisel. It is not required and you may find yourself reaching the end of this series of exercises without needing to read it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do find yourself in that situation, go take a short read of it anyways, the \"how to print stuff\" information is useful for when you are working in Chipyard."

If you need more help understanding how Chisel Tests work: https://github.com/agile-hw/lectures/blob/main/02-hello/lec02-hello.ipynb (Search: \"Brief ChiselTest Intro\")\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR:\n",
    "* `poke` - Set value of wire\n",
    "* `peek` - Read value of wire\n",
    "* `expect` - read value & compare (assert)\n",
    "* `clock.step(x)` - ticks the clock x times\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Chisel Test?\n",
    "* By default, Chisel Test uses the [Treadle](https://github.com/chipsalliance/treadle) simulation engine, but it has native Verilator support as well.\n",
    "* The closest thing to compare Chisel Tests to is a Verilog test bench you might've written in EECS151.\n",
    "* You aren't running a binary -- You are essentially testing your circuit by driving individual wires... So Chisel Test is good for testing individual modules, but keep in mind this **will not** test/find issues when you start integrating, especially with existing Chipyard IP.\n",
    "* Generally it isn't too productive to spend a whole ton of time writing Chisel Tests... It is more of a \"sanity check\" -- In line with the Agile Design principals, you should get the most basic implementation complete to a state where you can run a \"hello world\" RISC-V binary on it. Then define the workload you would eventually want your block to run in the RISC-V binary/Baremetal tests. It'll then fail horribly for the workload that you want it to eventually do -- but that's OK! You can then iterate towards that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write your own test that tests `CombLogic` exhaustively for all input values `a, b, and c`. The module should return `true` if and only if all calls to `dut.io.out.expect(...)` succeed.\n"

Then that byte code is run on the JVM, which elaborates your design using dependencies from the Chisel Plugin/Library. During elaboration, a Chisel IR is generated which takes the shape of a graph of the hardware you have described. This then is converted (or you can emit/dump Chisel IR, but that's not very helpful) to CHIRRTL (also known as \"high-firrtl\"). Then, CHIRRTL is descended down to the FIRRTL representation.
